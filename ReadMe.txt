Issues in VCL system :
I use spyder IDE and the input requesting commands are displayed in the console, for ex: Enter interarrival time.

But in VCL system the input requesting commands are displayed in the output file.

NOTE : 
Initially , the first arrival comes at t=2 (This is an assumption and it is same as taken in Simulation Task 1)
